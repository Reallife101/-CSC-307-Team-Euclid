## Set Up
### Downloads
To begin setting up the project for development, the following should be installed:

1. A Text editor (we recommend [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), but everything from Notepad++ to TextEdit works too)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
4. [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

### Setting up the Environment
First, set up the repository by cloning it to your workspace. The pages folder holds all of the seperate pages of the website. Each page is represented by a folder containing its front end and back end components. All style sheets should be within the style_sheets folder.
